# Machine-Learning-Pneumonia-Detection-with-Chest-Xray-images-
This project has been made as a school assignment, with another collegue of mine. He has posted all our notebooks on his page : 

I have developped a Decision Tree and Random Forest approach, whereas he focused on a Multilayer Perceptron approach, then we both coded the CNN approach,
which is our best model so far.

The dataset of XRay images used in this notebook can be retrieved using this link :

I have also developed a CNN model for a deep-learning approach to this problem.
You can also find it on my friend's page
