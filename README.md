# Machine-Learning-Pneumonia-Detection-with-Chest-Xray-images-
This project has been made as a school assignment, with another collegue of mine. 
He has posted all our notebooks on his page : 
https://github.com/ggleKg/Projet_Detection_Pneumonie
We have developped a Decision Tree and Random Forest approach, then focused on a Multilayer Perceptron and a CNN approach,
which is our best model so far.
